# Problem 8: Game Enemy Character Creation

## Problem Statement

A game requires multiple enemy characters with similar attributes. Creating each one from scratch is expensive because initialization involves heavy resource loading (e.g., 3D models, textures).

## Design Pattern Solution: Prototype

### Why Prototype?

The Prototype pattern is the perfect solution because:

1. **Expensive Initialization**: Loading 3D models and textures is costly
2. **Similar Objects**: Enemies share similar attributes with minor variations
3. **Performance**: Cloning is much faster than creating from scratch
4. **Flexibility**: Can clone and then modify specific attributes
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Load resources once, clone many times

### The Problem: Expensive Object Creation

Without Prototype, creating each enemy is expensive:

```java
// Problem: Expensive initialization on every creation
class Goblin {
    private String name;
    private int health;
    private int attackPower;
    
    public Goblin() {
        // Expensive operations - done EVERY time!
        System.out.println("Loading Goblin 3D model...");      // Slow I/O
        System.out.println("Loading Goblin textures...");       // Slow I/O
        System.out.println("Initializing Goblin animations..."); // Slow computation
        // Simulate expensive operations
        try {
            Thread.sleep(100); // 100ms per creation!
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        
        this.name = "Goblin";
        this.health = 50;
        this.attackPower = 10;
    }
}

// Creating 100 goblins = 100 × 100ms = 10 seconds! 😱
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    Goblin goblin = new Goblin(); // Expensive every time!
}
```

**Problems with direct creation:**
- ❌ **Performance**: Expensive initialization repeated for each object
- ❌ **Resource waste**: Loading same resources multiple times
- ❌ **Slow**: Game performance suffers from repeated I/O operations
- ❌ **Memory inefficient**: Duplicate resource loading
- ❌ **No reuse**: Can't reuse expensive initialization

### The Solution: Prototype Pattern

The Prototype pattern solves these problems by:
- ✅ **Load once**: Initialize expensive resources once
- ✅ **Clone many**: Fast cloning for subsequent objects
- ✅ **Performance**: Cloning is much faster than initialization
- ✅ **Resource efficient**: Share loaded resources
- ✅ **Flexible**: Can customize clones after creation

### Solution Overview

- **Prototype Interface**: `Enemy` interface with `clone()` method
- **Concrete Prototypes**: `Goblin`, `Orc` classes that implement cloning
- **Expensive Initialization**: Done once in constructor (loads 3D models, textures)
- **Fast Cloning**: Private constructor for clones (no expensive operations)
- **Client**: Creates one prototype, then clones it multiple times

Instead of `new Goblin()` (which loads 3D models every time), we:
1. Create one prototype: `Goblin goblinPrototype = new Goblin();` (expensive, done once)
2. Clone many times: `Enemy goblin1 = goblinPrototype.clone();` (fast!)

### Key Benefits

- ✅ Avoids expensive initialization on every creation
- ✅ Fast object creation through cloning
- ✅ Can customize clones after creation
- ✅ Efficient resource usage (load once, clone many)
- ✅ Supports prototype registry for common enemy types
- ✅ Better game performance

### Comparison: Without vs With Prototype

| Aspect | Without Prototype | With Prototype |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Initialization** | ❌ Expensive every time | ✅ Expensive once |
| **Performance** | ❌ Slow (100ms per object) | ✅ Fast (clone is instant) |
| **Resource Usage** | ❌ Loads resources repeatedly | ✅ Loads once, reuses |
| **Memory** | ❌ High (duplicate resources) | ✅ Low (shared resources) |
| **Scalability** | ❌ Doesn't scale | ✅ Scales well |

**Example Performance:**
- **Without Prototype**: Creating 100 goblins = 100 × 100ms = **10 seconds**
- **With Prototype**: 1 × 100ms (prototype) + 99 × 0ms (clones) = **0.1 seconds**
